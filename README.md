# ActivityLogger
simple activity logger for roblox places with discord webhook

All groupID, StaffRank and discors webhooks provided in the script must be changed, as they will log a sample group, not yours.

# Discord webhooks will not work.
You need to paste your webhook into https://hooks.hyra.io/ and generate one from the proxy.

# Final Product
If you've done setup correctly, a message like this one will be logged in your selected webhook channel.
